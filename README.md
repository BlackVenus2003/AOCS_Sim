# AOCS_Sim
A MATLAB/Simulink-based modular Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) framework designed for LEO satellites. This project models realistic spacecraft dynamics, sensors, actuators, and control algorithms for research and academic use.

>>Full 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics (attitude + orbital motion)
>>Modular sensor suite with noise, dropout, and rate modeling:
>>LQR-based optimal control with tunable A, B, Q, R matrices
>>Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for attitude and angular velocity estimation
>>Quaternion-based attitude kinematics

#models contains main model and subsystem models.

#scripts contain various scripts used, can modify as conveneint/required.

#docs contain refernece graphs, model architecture.

Happy tinkering!!
