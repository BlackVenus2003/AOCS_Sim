# AOCS_Sim
A MATLAB/Simulink-based modular Attitude and Orbit Control System (AOCS) framework designed for LEO satellites. This project models realistic spacecraft dynamics, sensors, actuators, and control algorithms for research and academic use.


#models contains main model and subsystem models.

#scripts contain various scripts used, can modify as conveneint/required.

#docs contain refernece graphs, model architecture.

Happy tinkering!!
